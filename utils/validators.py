Key Components:
    Food Entry Validation: This function checks if a food entry contains all
      required fields and that no field is empty. It's tailored to ensure that 
      critical data is not missing before the application processes or stores it.
    
    User Input Validation: Validates that the input matches the expected data type,
      which is crucial for preventing type errors and ensuring that data conforms 
      to expected formats before processing.

Extending This Module:
    You can extend this module by adding more specific validation functions.
      For example, you might add functions to validate numerical ranges, 
      string patterns (using regex), or complex data structures.
    
    Consider adding error handling or logging mechanisms to record validation
      failures, which could aid in debugging and maintaining the application.
